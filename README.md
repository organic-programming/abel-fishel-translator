# Abel-Fishel Translator

> *"One thought, every tongue."*

Babel Fish is the multilingual holon. It translates Markdown documents
between languages while preserving structure, YAML frontmatter, code
blocks, and Cartouche metadata.

Named after Douglas Adams' Babel Fish — the small, yellow, leech-like
creature that provides instant translation when placed in the ear.

## Commands

```
